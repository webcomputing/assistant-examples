Here are some small example applications to help you getting started with [AssistantJS][1]. Each of them shows you how to use 1-3 of [AssistantJS][1]'s core concepts. Happy hacking! :-)

## Pizza bakery: sessions and levenshtein distance
Make up your own pizza by putting your favourite ingredients on it ("Add tuna to my pizza!") and ask for all mentioned ingredients ("Whats on my pizza so far?") whenever you like. This example teaches you how to deal with [AssistantJS's session management][2] and introduces you into AssistantJS's implementation of the [Levenshtein distance][3].
